<p>Have you ever heard people say that they tend to be more of a right-brain or left-brain thinker? From books to television programs, you have probably heard the term 1)<font color=green>mentioned</font> numerous times, or perhaps you have even taken an online test to 2)<font color=green>determine</font> which type best describes you.<br/><br/>
Do different parts of the brain really control different bodily and mental functions? Over the years, a theory that has 3)<font color=green>gained</font> in popularity is that the right brain and the left brain are 4)<font color=green>responsible</font> for different modes of thought and that the way in which a person thinks will depend on which side of his brain works more actively.<br/><br/>
People who rely more 5)<font color=green>heavily</font> on the right half of their brain tend to be more imaginative and spontaneous. They are interested in patterns, shapes and sizes, for the right brain is associated with 6)<font color=green>artistic</font> ability like singing, painting, writing poetry, etc. Left-brain dominated people are quite 7)<font color=green>opposite</font> in the way they think. They tend to be more logical and 8)<font color=green>analytical</font> in their thinking and usually stand out in mathematics and word skills.<br/><br/>
While the different functions of the two brain parts may have been 9)<font color=green>distorted</font> and exaggerated by popular psychology, understanding your strengths and weaknesses in certain areas can help you develop better ways to learn and study. For example, if you are usually 10)<font color=green>stumped</font> in trying to follow verbal instructions, an activity often cited as a right-brain characteristic, you can benefit from writing down directions and developing better organizational skills.</p>

<p>I was once in a relationship with a woman who was the most brilliant, creative and driven person I&#39;d ever known. I told her these things often because she didn&#39;t see herself this way, despite 1)<font color=green>achieving</font> great success and acclaim (称赞</font> in her professional field. She was also 2)<font color=green>gorgeous</font> and sexy, though she seemed not to realize this either, so I told her these things too. But while I thought it was more important to praise her brilliance, it seemed to mean more to her that she was 3)<font color=green>considered</font> attractive.<br/><br/>
My experience with this girlfriend exemplifies a common phenomenon in life – when it comes to complimenting a woman, men often walk a very difficult line. Of course, 4)<font color=green>context</font> matters. In a professional setting, talking about appearance is often inappropriate, but at a singles club, it may be important. She will be very pleased if a man thinks her clothes and 5)<font color=green>accessories</font> are pretty, or her hair looks wonderful. However, things in between these two cases are unclear. Women have every right to be recognized and 6)<font color=green>appreciated</font> for their intelligence and creativity. But at the same time, they want to be admired for their looks as well, for example, their perfect skin 7)<font color=green>complexion</font> and elegant outfits.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, most guys don&#39;t understand this. If we receive compliments from women, they&#39;re usually about our achievements, not our looks. Most of us don&#39;t expect a woman to tell us how 8)<font color=green>handsome</font> or sexy we are, and some of us would find it hard to regard such a(n</font> 9)<font color=green>comment</font> as sincere.<br/><br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s very hard to be a guy these days. It is important for every man to understand how to treat women with both respect and 10)<font color=green>admiration</font>. But as far as the right balance of these two is concerned, we really have no frame of reference, especially when it comes to looks.</p>

<p>Farming invariably interferes with the habitats of plants and animals. However, this does not necessarily mean that agriculture and biodiversity are 1)<font color=green>incompatible</font>. In fact, quite the opposite is true. The sustainable cultivation of plants for food and feed actually enables us to 2)<font color=green>preserve</font> biodiversity.<br/><br/>
By 2007, there were more than twice as many people living on the planet as there were in 1961. Over the same period, the total amount of 3)<font color=green>available</font> arable (可耕的</font> land grew by just 10 percent. In comparison with population growth, the expansion of arable land was small. And there are limits to further expansion. A large 4)<font color=green>proportion</font> of the earth&#39;s surface – like deserts – is not suitable for cultivation, and other areas are 5</font> <font color=green>utilized</font> by humans for roads and buildings. Some land that is rich in biodiversity needs to be preserved and thus should not be 6)<font color=green>converted</font> into arable land. The tropical rain forests, for example, have the highest species density in the world, and changing this land for crop cultivation would be 7)<font color=green>dreadful</font> to these species&#39; habitats and, indeed, existence.<br/><br/>
By 2050, global demand for food will have risen by 70 percent. But the expansion of land available for cultivation has its limits. This is one of the greatest challenges facing agriculture today: How do we 8)<font color=green>balance</font> the increased demand for food with the need to maintain biological diversity, now and in the future?<br/><br/>
Efficient and 9)<font color=green>sane</font> use of land will be key to preserving natural animal and plant habitats. To achieve this aim will depend to a(n</font> 10)<font color=green>considerable</font> extent on the use of modern agricultural methods. If these methods are successfully applied, we believe that agriculture and biodiversity can coexist in harmony.</p>

<p>Stereotypes have some truth mixed in with a few generalizations. Sometimes these generalizations can be misleading as they are often based on observation of the 1)<font color=green>exterior</font> behavior of people in a certain culture. Spaghetti, pasta, mafia (黑手党</font>, gestures, fashion – these are some words commonly used to describe Italians. How much truth is there in the stereotype? As an Italian myself, I will give you some 2)<font color=green>insights</font> into the Italian soul and clarify some misunderstandings that foreigners have about us.<br/><br/>
Spaghetti and pasta are sacred. You can&#39;t take pasta away from an Italian meal; otherwise it won&#39;t be 3)<font color=green>complete</font>. A typical Italian meal generally includes pasta as a starter, fish or meat with salad as the main 4)<font color=green>course</font>, followed by fruit or dessert, and then coffee. But there are considerable regional differences in Italy, and hence 5)<font color=green>inconsistencies</font> exist between the stereotype and reality. For instance, you might find risotto (加有肉、鱼或蔬菜的调味饭</font> replacing pasta in some places!<br/><br/>
The Mafia is real: We are not proud of it, but it does exist, especially in the South and on the island of Sicily. Obviously, not every Italian is a member of the Mafia, and most will be 6)<font color=green>offended</font> if you use the term, even if you are just joking.<br/><br/>
Yes, the way we speak is unique. Italians use 7)<font color=green>gestures</font> a lot in communication. We simply cannot talk without our hands. If the hands are busy doing something else, we start moving shoulders or other parts of the body.<br/><br/>
We are also fashion victims. You can recognize Italians by the way they dress from head to toe. We wear stylish clothes and 8)<font color=green>ornaments</font> for every possible occasion. You won&#39;t ever see an Italian wearing running shorts combined with long socks: It&#39;s simply against our 9)<font color=green>sense</font> of style!<br/><br/>
Italy is made up of many regions and provinces which are similar in some ways and 10)<font color=green>distinctive</font> in others. The stereotype contains some truth, but being Italian takes a lot more than that.</p>

<h3 id="banked-cloze">Banked cloze</h3>
<p>To invest in women&#39;s education and health is important for the overall welfare of the human society. The 1)<font color=green>reason</font> for saying so is obvious, that is, women are playing important roles in modern society. The politicians who 2)<font color=green>levy</font> taxes should know that women contribute to 40 percent of the world&#39;s production in agriculture, a quarter in industry, and a third in services. Women farmers in the developing countries grow at least 50 percent of the world&#39;s food. In addition to 3)<font color=green>generating</font> income, women continue to take responsibilities for household activities such as childcare, cleaning and preparing food, which are sometimes not as 4)<font color=green>lightweight</font> and easy as generally thought.<br/><br/>
Yet women&#39;s productivity remains low. Improving women&#39;s productivity can greatly benefit economic growth and poverty 5)<font color=green>reduction</font>, which are key development goals around the world. Hence, to 6)<font color=green>enhance</font> women&#39;s status is a vital part of the World Bank&#39;s strategy for broadly based economic and human resource development.<br/><br/>
To improve women&#39;s welfare calls for the efforts of both women and men. If long-term change in the conditions of women is to be 7)<font color=green>achieved</font>, the actions and attitudes of men must change, rather than simply to 8)<font color=green>emancipate</font> women from old conventions. Problems affecting women are often closely related to the social 9)<font color=green>relationships</font> between men and women. For example, it is impossible to deal with women&#39;s health problems effectively through 10)<font color=green>approaches</font> that involve only women. Many women&#39;s health problems are embedded in unequal gender relation in work loads, responsibilities for family welfare, as well as access to resources and decision-making.</p>
